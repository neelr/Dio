A slack bot for Summer of Making, to help mentors and mentees!

### Utitilites!

So what can you do with this?

- **Schedule Meetings with a mentor**  
On the off chance that you request a mentor, and get paired with one, you can schedule meetings with your mentor!

- **Write Updates**  
Write updates on your project and attach images. This is to let us know how you're going for your project! Try to write *at least* 1 update per week to keep us informed! Also, attach images and files by DM'ing the bot the attachment with the ID as the message!

- **Events**  
RSVP to Summer of Making Events! This includes the weekly get togethers, and other fun activities we have planned! Check every few days and make sure to add these to your calender! (hint: a cool thing you can do is `/remind me at (event time) to join event` which will DM you when the event comes!)

Have fun!
